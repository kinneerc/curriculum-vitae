The ability to store and process large amounts of information has
brought great benefits to society.  This ``big data'' enabled scientists
to map the human genome, discover the Higgs boson, and manage international
commerce.   While collecting this data has brought many benefits to
society, it also comes with risks.  When critical systems such as air
traffic control rely on the quality of data, incorrect data can have
devastating consequences. As a computer science major, I am interested in ensuring that the
software systems that we depend on are reliable.

Since my sophomore year at Allegheny College, I have had the opportunity
to collaborate with Dr.\ Phil McMinn at the University of Sheffield, in
conjunction with my advisor Dr.\ Gregory Kapfhammer and their PhD student Chris Wright.
While I was analyzing the data from my experiments, I realized that I
was the first person in the world to know what the performance
trade-offs looked like for search-based test data generation for
database schemas. The excitement of discovery from this experience drove
me to participate in a summer research experience for undergraduates
(REU) program funded by the National Science Foundation. As part of this
program, I traveled to the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs to
use machine learning to evaluate the quality of test suites written for mobile applications. 

My research has resulted in published papers and released software. This
summer, I continued my collaboration with  Dr.\ McMinn, Dr.\ Kapfhammer
and Chris Wright, and presented our paper titled “Automatically
Evaluating the Efficiency of Search-based Test Data Generation for
Relational Database Schemas” at the 27th International Conference on
Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering. Our software for
conducting automatic scalability experiments is available on GitHub.

This year I am continuing work in this broad area for my
undergraduate thesis, which focusses on generating test data for
database queries. I am also working on a continuation of our previous work
which we hope to submit to the ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics.

Upon graduating from Allegheny College, I would like to continue my education
in the United Kingdom with Dr.\ McMinn as the next step towards my long-term goal of
obtaining a PhD in computer science and pursuing a career as a research
scientist.
